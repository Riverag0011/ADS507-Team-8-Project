For your GitHub repository and code:

Your pipeline must be fully reproducible from the GitHub repository.
    Ideally, your pipeline is deployed using infrastructure as code (IaC)
    Document the deployment process in the README.
    Manual processes can be required in the deployment process, but these must be fully documented in your README.
Your pipeline must load data to a persistent data store.
    There are no restrictions on the type of data store.
    Your pipeline must include at least one SQL transformation of your data.
You must address and incorporate any feedback provided by the instructor on your Module 5 status report.

The README must include the following:
    An overview of the contents of the repository.
    How to deploy your pipeline.
    How to monitor your pipeline.
